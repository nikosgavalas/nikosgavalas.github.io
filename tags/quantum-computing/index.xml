      <description>Quantum Computers have gained much popularity recently because of their potential to outperform their classical counterparts in a variety of tasks.
In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll briefly go over some of their applications in Computing and Communication that fascinated me.
Quantum Algorithms Quantum Computers process information that, contrary to classical computers, is encoded in qubits (quantum states) instead of bits (logical states). A qubit is a vector in the 2-dimensional complex vector space (Hilbert space).</description>

      <description>The 2-SAT problem The Boolean Satisfiability problem, also known as the SAT problem, is the problem of determining if there exists a set of values for the variables of a boolean expression so that it evaluates to TRUE. It has been proven to be NP-Complete, and is one of the most important and famous problems in Computer Science because it is the problem most used to prove other problems to belong in the complexity class NP, via reductions.</description>
